1.1 DECIMAL, BINARY & HEXADECIMAL

Humans use the denary (decimal) number system everyday. This system consists of ten symbols:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. These symbols are used to write numbers, for example, 823.
This number is made up of 8 hundreds (100s), 2 tens (10s) and 3 ones (1s). The order of the
number is important because the column values are ten times bigger than the previous value as
we move from right to left. Because it uses ten symbols, decimal or denary is known as the 
base 10 number system. However, denary is not the only number system.

An alternative number system is called binary. It consists of only two symbols: 0 and 1.
Just as in denary, the values of a binary number are twice as big as the previous one, as 
we move from right to left. The column values for a binary number, from left to right, would be:
128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2 and 1. Since binary uses only two symbols, it is known as a base 2
number system. This number system is the only one understood by computers.

Programmers make use of another number system called hexadecimal (hex for short). Hex uses
sixteen symbols, thus it is a base 16 number system. It uses the symbols 0 - 9 for the first ten
digits, just like decimal, then the letters A - F for the other six symbols. The column values
for base 16 are based on multiples of 16, so the first two columns are: 16 and 1. The second
column is sixteen times larger than the first column.
